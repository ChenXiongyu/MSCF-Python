# MSCF Python Programming Basics 2022

## Homework 1

I will just use quote mark # since I am using an IDE.

### 1. Fib Function

* Integer type of data has no upper limit in Python
* Pay attention to the robustness of the program.
* I use try and except to cope with the robustness problem.

### 2. Operators

* % can deal with floats.

### 3. Sum of Integers

* I use the sum formula to avoid loop.

### 4. Type Conversion

* int and float can cause errors when input type is str or None.
* str and bool are robust in some way.

### 5. IDE choice

* VSCode > Pycharm > Spyder > IDLE

## Homework 2

Maybe add some try except section to improve robustness of the program.

### 1. Formatted Output, File Input, and lists

#### b. Simple Statistics on a list

* In the format string '{:8.2f}', 8 always stands for the total length of the string, rather than the length of integral part.

### 2. list, tuple, set, and dict

#### c. subscript notation

* Watch the assignment order!

#### n. insert

* Pay attention to the arguments in insert function.

#### o. tuple

* Print tuple (4), only showing 4.

#### r. set

* The way to create an empty set is set().

## Homework 3

### 2. Collection Construction and Comprehension

#### d. tuple & sort

* The code can be simplified maybe.

#### h. multiple assignment

* Is there a multiple assignment for a dict?

### 3. Commodity Futures and Option Contracts

* Many hard codes.
* Add some annotations.
