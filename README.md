# MSCF Python Programming Basics 2022

## Homework 1

I will just use quote mark # since I am using an IDE.

### 1. Fib Function

* Integer type of data has no upper limit in Python
* Pay attention to the robustness of the program.
* I use try and except to cope with the robustness problem.

### 2. Operators

* % can deal with floats.

### 3. Sum of Integers

* I use the sum formula to avoid loop.

### 4. Type Conversion

* int and float can cause errors when input type is str or None.
* str and bool are robust in some way.

### 5. IDE choice

* VSCode > Pycharm > Spyder > IDLE

## Homework 2

Maybe add some try except section to improve robustness of the program.

### 1. b 

In the format string '{:8.2f}', 8 always stands for the total length of the string, rather than the length of integral part.
